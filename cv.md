### Summary

My experience includes over 5 years of self-employment as DotNetNuke CMS skin developer and product support agent. This work gave me a strong knowledge of HTML/CSS, basic knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery as well as strong communication skills in both, written and spoken English. I managed multiple custom projects, support tickets and direct Skype calls with clients all around the globe. All the main projects were done in collaboration with other developers using version control systems - SVN at the beginning of my employment and Git via Bitbucket currently. 

My goal is to be become a skilled web developer with full stack of required knowledge. So I’d like to generalize my knowledge of HTML/CSS with latest best practices, learn deeper JavaScript and js frameworks, master Git and GitHub and improve my English language to be fluent. Also, I’m interested in working in large teams as it seems to me like a valuable experience that I miss currently. 

### Skills and Experience

Below you can review my main skills list:

1. HTML/CSS knowledge
2. JavaScript and jQuery basics
3. Git/GitHub and command line basic knowledge
4. Written and spoken English - B1 level
5. Patience and ability to use positive language even with grumpy and angry clients

  * **Notice**: This custom project was made in collaboration with Africa based content manager/web developer. I was responsible for styling, template and third party modules customization to fit client’s design. My colleague was in charge of content management. 

Both project were adjusted by client during working process, but still managed in time.
